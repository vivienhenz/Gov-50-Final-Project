## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to climate change and climate vulnerability. I think I could make an interesting project out of investing who is more likely to suffer from climate change impacts based on certain demographics. If thats not possible, I think i'll lean more into polling on climate and see whether or not a certain factor will make someone vote more towards politicians that include climate change mitigation/adaptation in their campaigns.
